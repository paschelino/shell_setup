# paschelino's shell setup
Hi, great you're here. If you like, make use of what I have put together here. For me, coming from pure bash and vim, 
this was like a change from horse riding to spaceship flying. 😌 I hope this is also helpful for your daily work and passion.

To get you started easily with nvim, make use of two awesome features provided by the LazyVim distribution used here:
* `<leader>`: Open a pop up to see the next best key to press.
* `<leader>sk`: Open a search for keymappings.

What does `<leader>` mean? This is the key to start a command. It is configured here to be the `<space>` key. Thus to search for 
keymappings, type `<space>sk`.

## 🧐 Please note: 
The fact this setup works for me does not mean it works for you, too. Dotfiles are highly individual.
Yet, I have tried to optimize the combination of tools and configs and have been soaking in knowledge from multiple awesome
YouTube videos. Here are some to name a few:
- [Neovim Lua Plugin From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Lp4cV8YR0)

## preconditions:
### Mac Package Manager
If you use MacPorts, this here won't work. Sorry. It is based on Homebrew (which will be installed in case you haven't before).

### Rustup & Rust
Don't install `rustup` via Homebrew. It will be installed via the contained install script, to have proper use of Cargo.

### Conflicts with existing dotfiles or dotfile folders
You might run into problems with `stow`, in case some dotfiles already exist in your home directory. 
Best is to move them into some backup place, before you run `./install`.

## what you will install:
For a detailed look on what you will install, please have a look into
- the script `./install`
- the `Brewfile`
- the `cargo_installs.sh`

On a high level after the install you will have
- NeoVim, highly configured to be a fully fledged IDE
- Ghostty, a highly modern TTY
- Nushell, a (non POSIX compliant) modern extreme awesome DevUX shell
- Starship, a shell prompt on steorids
- tmux, a massive productivity booster when you are working on multiple projects
- Rustup and Rust, to inspire you to code in Rust, but also to install awesome Rust software like nushell ;-)
- and more basic stuff that you need

## How to change things
- Please note, a dotfiles config is highly individual. Use this for creating your own dotfiles repository.

## How to install:
Open your shell and run `./install`
There is no guarantee that this runs through, but, as I want it to work, it is likely...

## Dotfile management:
The install script also installs the tool `stow`. It is used for symlinking the dotfile folders in this repository
into your homefolder. In case you need to run the command once manually, do it as follows:
```shell
cd <some_parent_folder>/shell_setup/dotfiles

# when in bash or a similar shell:
stow --target="$HOME" <package>

# when already in nushell:
stow --target=$"($env.home)" <package>
```

So let's assume, you have cloned the repository into a folder like `~/projects/shell_setup` and you wish to symlink the package ghostty:
```shell
cd ~/projects/shell_setup
ls
# output:
# ╭───┬──────────┬──────┬──────┬──────────────╮
# │ # │   name   │ type │ size │   modified   │
# ├───┼──────────┼──────┼──────┼──────────────┤
# │ 0 │ ghostty  │ dir  │ 96 B │ 6 hours ago  │
# │ 1 │ nushell  │ dir  │ 96 B │ 6 hours ago  │
# │ 2 │ nvim     │ dir  │ 96 B │ 6 hours ago  │
# │ 3 │ personal │ dir  │ 96 B │ 7 months ago │
# │ 4 │ starship │ dir  │ 96 B │ 6 hours ago  │
# │ 5 │ tmux     │ dir  │ 96 B │ 6 hours ago  │
# ╰───┴──────────┴──────┴──────┴──────────────╯

# now run:

# when in bash or a similar shell:
stow --target="$HOME" ghostty

# when already in nushell:
stow --target=$"($env.home)" ghostty
```

### this will create a symlink looking like this:

```shell
ls -la ~/.config
# output:
# ╭────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬─...

```

## tmux
For full developer productivity, I advise you to remap your CAPS_LOCK key to CTRL, short C. Then it is super simple to use 
the according key mappings and for example to press C+a,w to open the window selector. It feels a little bit like 
emacs, as every command you will be using will be preceded with C+a.

## NeoVim
It will take you some time to become familiar with nvim. Two things to ease things for you:
1. When you are inside a buffer in normal mode, you can hit the SPACE bar. It then expects to type in shortcuts to execute the needed
commands. But after short time, it opens a pop up with the available keymappings, so that you can learn them slowly.
2. When you are in edit mode in a buffer and want to get back to normal mode, instead of hitting ESC, you can type short after another `jk`.
This will enter your muscle memory very quickly and you will never want to miss it again.
3. When you want to know all capabilities available, it is best to look into the `~/.config/nvim` folder and to browse the plugin configs.
Each of the plugin configs relates to a GitHub project where you can find more details on how to use those. Tools you might love the most:
- LazyGit (hit SPACE+lg)
- Toggle file explorer (hit SPACE+ee to open or SPACE+et to close it.)
- Opening or closing folders in the file explorer: Hit enter to open, hit backspace to close. Or use double clicks with the mouse :-D
- Open the key bindings for the file explorer: When in the file explorer hit `g?`
