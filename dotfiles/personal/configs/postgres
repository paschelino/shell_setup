# Post installation info when installing via homebrew:

# This formula has created a default database cluster with:
#  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@13
# For more details, read:
#   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-initdb.html
#
# postgresql@13 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
# because this is an alternate version of another formula.
#
# If you need to have postgresql@13 first in your PATH, run:
#   echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@13/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/paschelino/.bash_profile
#
# For compilers to find postgresql@13 you may need to set:
#  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@13/lib"
#  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@13/include"
#
# For pkg-config to find postgresql@13 you may need to set:
#  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@13/lib/pkgconfig"
#
# To start postgresql@13 now and restart at login:
#   brew services start postgresql@13
# Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
#   /opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@13/bin/postgres -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@13
